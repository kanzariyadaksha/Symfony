Any matter and/or dispute relating in any way to your visit to or interaction with the Website, including compliance with these Terms, which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided in the Section entitled Arbitration below.</p>

            <h5 class="title">Arbitration</h5>
            
            <p>If the parties don't reach an agreed upon solution pursuant to the Initial Dispute-Resolution contemplated in the Section above, you and the Company each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to our products or services or the Website (including, without limitation, <?php echo $domain;?>, the products or services offered through the Website, any mobile/tablet sites or social media presence, and any related company), or these Terms or the breach, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, shall be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. Notwithstanding our right to modify these Terms, the Company agrees that we may not modify these arbitration provisions without notice to you and your agreement to such changes. Further, any such modification to the dispute and/or arbitration requirements shall not apply to claims arising prior to the date of such modification and any such changes shall not affect your prior election to opt out of arbitration as provided below. In connection with these arbitration provisions, the parties agree as follows:</p>
            
            <p>This arbitration agreement is reciprocally binding on all parties such that both you and the Company are required to arbitrate claims;</p>
            
            <p>Remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties under applicable federal, state or local laws, including the recovery of attorney's fees, remain available under this arbitration clause;</p>

            <p>The arbitrator must be neutral and the parties will each have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator;</p>
            
            <p>You have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area within the United States;</p>
            
            <p>You have the right to the use of counsel of your choosing at your own expense if you so elect, and to recover attorneys' fees and expenses of arbitration to the extent provided by law;</p>
            
            <p>The parties are permitted the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute in accordance with JAMS procedures; and</p>
            
            <p>The arbitrator's award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
            
            <p>Arbitration Filing Fees. If you initiate the arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the lesser of $250 or the cost of filing a lawsuit, the Company will pay the additional cost. A request for payment of any such fees should be submitted to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS. All other costs of the arbitration will be split among the parties including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services. You will be responsible for your own attorney fees and expenses unless the arbitration rules or applicable law permit you to recover your attorney’s fees.</p>
            
            <h5 class="title">Waiver of Certain Rights from Court.</h5>
            
            <p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court. Court proceedings generally provide greater discovery rights, a judge or jury trial, and could provide greater opportunity for appellate review. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.</p>
            
            <h5 class="title">Class Action Waiver.</h5>
            
            <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.</p>
            
            <h5 class="title">Exception – Small Claims Court Claims.</h5>
            
            <p>Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. Any appeal of the decision in such small claims court shall be subject to these arbitration provisions.</p>
            
            

            <h5 class="title">30-Day Right to Opt-Out.</h5>
            
            <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address <?php echo $contactAddress;?>. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Website, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with these Terms. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>

                
            
            <p>YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION OR OTHER ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU INTEND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND, IN ADDITION TO OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, YOU AGREE THAT THE COMPANYâ€™S AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS CONSTITUTES CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH WAIVER. THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CAN NOT BE SEVERED FROM THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.</p>
