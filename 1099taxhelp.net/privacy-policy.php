          <p>This Online Privacy Policy (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Notice") applies to this <?php echo $website;?> online interface (i.e. website or mobile application) owned and operated by Forward Leap Marketing ("Company"), and any Company affiliate or subsidiary online interface that links to the Notice (each, a Site, and, collectively, Sites). This Notice outlines how Sites may collect, use and share information from or about you, and explains how information may be collected and used for advertising purposes. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand the online information security practices of Company. For additional details about the Site and the information provided on the Site, please review our Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
	        <p><strong>Agreement to this Policy</strong>: By visiting this Site, and/or submitting any information on any of the forms linked to this Privacy Policy you are accepting the practices described herein.</p>

          <p>You must be at least 18 years old and may not reside in the European Union to use our Sites. We do not knowingly collect, process, use or disclose Personal Information about visitors under 18 years of age and/or from the European Union. If you are the parent or guardian of a minor under 18 years of age and believe that such minor has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at so that we may delete the minor's information from our database.</p>
	        <p><strong>Consent to Being Contacted</strong>: You agree to share your information with our network of companies for them to contact you (including through automated means; e.g. autodialing, text and pre-recorded messaging) with offers via telephone, mobile device (including SMS and MMS) and/or email, even if your telephone number is currently listed on any state, federal or corporate Do Not Call list. You understand that consent is not a condition of purchase.</p>
	        <h5 class="title">1. How we collect information</h5>

	        <p class="privacyItem">User IP Address</p>

          <p>Each time a visitor/user (a "User") visits the Site, our web server automatically recognizes the User's IP address and the Web page from which the User came. The User's IP address is used to help identify the User and to gather broad demographic information about the User. We also use IP addresses collected to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Sites, and to better serve Users in using the services and features of the Sites.</p>
	        <p class="privacyItem">Cookies and Action Tags</p>

          <p>The first time a User provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at a Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the User's computer/device. Whenever that user comes back to a Site using the same computer/device, the cookie allows the Site to identify the User and to recall the User's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on a Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may use the information stored in our database (i) for the purpose for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a User wishes to sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or offers in the future; (iii) to ensure that a User will not be repeatedly exposed to the same ads, offers and promotions while visiting Sites; and (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a User, include offers, promotions or advertisements historically, or likely to be, of interest to that User.</p>
          <p>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on a site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Sites and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased.</p>
	        <p class="privacyItem">Personal Information</p>

          <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" shall mean individually identifiable information from or about an individual including, but not limited to: (a) a first and last name; (b) a home or other physical address, including street name and name of city or town; (c) an e-mail address or other online contact information, such as an instant messaging user identifier or a screen name that reveals and individual's e-mail address; (d) a telephone number; (e) a Social Security number; (f) a persistent identifier, such as a customer number held in a cookie or processor serial number, that is combined with other available data that identifies and individual; (g) age; (h) income level; (i) hobbies, buying patterns or preferences; or (j) any other information from or about an individual that is combined with any of (a) through (i) above. By registering with, or providing Personal Information to a Site, as well as providing permission to receive marketing offers, Users allow us, our affiliates, partners and certain approved third parties to make their personally identifiable information available to third parties in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Policy of the respective affiliated sites. We may collect "Personal Information" from a User visiting our Site.</p>

               <li>to send you e-mails regarding system downtime and/or changes to this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions of Use.</li>
               <li>collected through our social media pages and other online interactions with you to assist in verifying your identity and account status. We may combine this online information with information collected from offline sources or information we already have;</li>

            </ul>
        	</p>

          <p>We may also combine the information we have gathered about users with information from other sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Sites or administer activities on our behalf.</p>
          <p>You may, at any time, notify us that you do not wish to have your Personal Information disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail to <a href='mailto:<?php echo $email;?>'><?php echo $email;?></a></p>
        
	        <h5 class="title">3. How We Use Demographic Information</h5>

          <p>We use demographic information to tailor Sites to the interests of our users. Demographic information is shared with advertisers so that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic information may also be shared with other third parties.</p>
	        <h5 class="title">4. Other Sites</h5>

          <p>Other sites accessible through our Sites have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Please be aware that our Sites may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those websites linked to our Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit Personal Information. Additionally, other companies that place advertising on our Sites may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.</p>
          <p>On behalf of various sponsors, we may provide sponsored links to third-party websites. If you click on a sponsored link or banner ad, a "window" or "frame" containing a third-party's web site may appear in the foreground with a Site in the background. Unless you are on one of our Sites, any time that you have moved to a window, you should assume that your Personal Information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the windowed site's privacy policy (if any).

	        <h5 class="title">5. Our Security Precautions</h5>

          <p>The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We encrypt all of your personal and financial information and use our best efforts to prevent it from being read or intercepted as the information travels over the Internet. While we follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us (both during and once we receive it), no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

Users may make such request by e-mailing <a href='mailto:<?php echo $email;?>'><?php echo $email;?></a> However, deleting Personal Information or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from us or third parties will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business on a Site and for managing future communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not change or delete Personal Information already collected as part of a particular transaction in our database, which may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy. Users may need to contact third parties who may contact you directly in order to change the preferences for the use of personal information that they may have or use.</p>
